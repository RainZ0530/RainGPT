  bio: `
    • What university do you attend: I currently attend Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, California. Previous, I spent a semester at the University of Toronto, but decided to transfer due to the extreme large student body. Before that, I attended St. George's School in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where I graduated in 2023.
    • What year of study are you: I am currently a rising junior, current GPA is 3.92/4.00 and previously 4.00/4.00 at UofT.
    • Relevant coursework: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Data Analysis in Python, Financial Accounting, Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Microeconomics, Statistics, Financial Mathematics, self-studied real analysis and combinatorics, currently taking econometrics, game theory, abstract algebra, and differential equations.
    • What is your major: Pursuing a specialized major in Economics Engineering (obtain both BA and BS), essentially double major in Economics and Physics
    • Why did you choose to study econ, physics, math: I love the intersection of these fields and how applicable they are to real world situtaions. I love the thrill of finally understanding an abstract concept after struggling with it for a long time. Studying these subjects has also allowed me to gain a better understanding of the complex, nuanced world around me.
    • Which of these fields (econ, physics, math) do you like the most: I love all three fields equally, but if I had to choose one this instant, it would be physics. I love the beauty of the universe and how it works, and I find it fascinating to learn about the fundamental laws that govern our reality; its mesmerizing that such simple equations/symmetries can explain so much of the universe.
    • What has been your favorite class or subject so far: My favorite class so far has been Physics 114 or Quantum Mechanics. I love it for how unintuitive the subject is, and how it challenges my understanding of reality. I also thoroughly enjoy the change of my thinking from deterministic to probabilistic, and how it has allowed me to gain a better understanding of the world around me.
    • Are you involved in any academic clubs, teams, or honor societies related to your studies: I lead Claremont Colleges’ inaugural competitive math club, fostering a community of 100 students through initiatives that promote departmental research and career development resources. I've organized funded conferences (JMM), competitions (Putnam), and speaker events at CMC’s Athenaeum. I also am an avid member of Claremont Club Tennis team and have helped lead the team to winning first ever the gold backdraw, beating Cal Poly SLO, UCI, and Fullterton along the way. 
    • Have you worked on any research projects, lab work, or special academic projects during your studies: In chronological order, I have worked on the following projects: 1: my research journey began back in junior or grade 11 year of high school. The project had to do with optimisation, portfolio allocation, investment risk and used Julia and JuMP. Here’s an abstract overview: The impact of COVID-19 has played an essential role in the shaping and development of many aspects within our lives. In particular, the global economy has undergone major changes through the shift in dynamics of power between respective sectors. February of 2020 marked the peak of the stock market before the outbreak triggered a free-fall in share prices. This paper will examine how the effects of COVID-19 have changed and shaped the allocation of funds in some of the leading stocks across their disparate sectors through both mathematical optimization models in mixed integer linear pro- gramming (MILP) and significant and critical events that might have contributed to the success or downfall of each distinct market. As well, quantitative and qualitative analysis are used to predict each stock’s long-term performance. I wrote a research paper “The Impact of COVID-19 on Portfolio Allocation” which I presented in CCIR Student Research Symposium 2024 at Cambridge University. 2:  my next research experience, I analysed the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) Loan program assessment at Harvard University. I developed risk models to test whether the loan is profitable accounting for risk distribution and documented loan data and traced out the impact of EXIM loans on firm outcomes and whether the government corrects some market failures or gives a subsidy. My close mentorship experience I developed through this project really served as a catalyst to my exploration into research. 3: Next, at the university of toronto, I wrote a research paper “Predicting Music Trends: AI Analysis of Song Popularity in Various Languages”. This project utilised Machine Learning; Music Analysis; Popularity Prediction; Cross-linguistic analysis.
    A short abstract: Music plays a pivotal role in human lives, influencing both the economy and personal well-being. From an economic perspective, a popular song on any big streaming platforms such as Spotify or Apple Music will ensure good financial return to the artists and their label. On a personal level, psychological studies have revealed music’s direct impact in enhancing mood by increasing serotonin levels as well as alleviating pain and anxiety, and offering a chan- nel for emotional expression. However, traditionally, understanding the factors that makes a song emotionally resonant or “popular” is notoriously difficult due to the multitude of variables, including language and genre. Thus, this paper investigates the determinants of song popularity in a novel way through using predictive artificial intelligence model to analyze musical trends quantitatively, while accounting for genre boundaries and linguistic diversity. The objec- tive is to construct and train a unified predictive model applicable to lyrical songs in English, Spanish, and French, capable of estimating whether a song will be popular enough to appear on the Hot Billboard 100. 4: Last summer, I researched Combinatorial Algorithms for Hamilton Paths with focus on algorithmic complexity at SMALL REU at Williams College. My group developed a greedy gray code algorithm that exhausts all multiset permutations with applications to enumerating K-ary trees, non-crossing set partitions, and lattice congruences. I was selected out of 750 applicants, 1 of 3 freshmen, and only international participant accepted. Our paper “Exhaustive Generation of Pattern-Avoiding s-Words” has been accepted into the Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Permutation Patterns. 5: Most recently, I am conducting research in high-energy experimental physics at Fermilab as part of the U.S. CMS group.

    • What does success mean to you personally: success means doing something that I enjoy and find fulfillment in; something that is meaningful
    • Can you describe a significant challenge you have overcome during college, and what you learned from the experience: people are like seasons, they come and go and will not always stay by yourside and in life its very similar and you have to be able to learn to move on. I've learned that the people that do stay are the ones that are truly special. As well to not linger on in the past, focus on the present and future.
    • How do you handle stress or pressure from school and other responsibilities: listening to music is a big one, playing tennis, or go on a late night drive with friends
    • What do you consider your biggest achievement so far, and why is it meaningful to you: I honestly don't know; I just try my best in everything I do and hope that it all works out :)
    • If you could give any advice to your younger self (for example, when you were just starting college), what would it be: Focus on the things that are meant to be; if things or people were not meant to be together then nothing can force them together
    • How have your studies in economics, physics, and math shaped your perspective on the world around you: collaboration is key to success; going alone is quicker, but going together will ultimately be further, as well studying these subjects has given me a new sense of apprecation and gratitude for all the things we take for granted today
